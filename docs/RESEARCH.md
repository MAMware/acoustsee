# Considerations when designing an grid array

The physics of sound, human auditory perception, and music theory. 

**Constraints:** given a 45ms frame, the frequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz, and the role of tempo.

**Understanding a 45ms Frame**

A 45ms (0.045-second) frame is a very short duration of sound. To determine how many musical notes can be heard in this time, we need to consider:
- Human perception of pitch: For a sound to be perceived as a distinct musical note (with a recognizable pitch), the auditory system typically requires at least a few cycles of the sound wave. Lower frequencies (e.g., 20 Hz) have longer wavelengths, so fewer cycles fit in 45ms, making it harder to perceive pitch accurately compared to higher frequencies.
- Frequency range: The human hearing range is approximately 20 Hz to 20 kHz, which covers all audible musical notes (from roughly A0 at ~27.5 Hz to beyond C8 at ~4186 Hz, and even higher frequencies).

Let’s calculate the number of cycles for some frequencies in 45ms:
- At 20 Hz (lowest audible frequency):
Period = 1/20 = 0.05 seconds (50ms). In 45ms, you get 45/50 = 0.9 cycles. This is less than one full cycle, so it’s unlikely to be perceived as a distinct pitch.
- At 100 Hz (e.g., near G2):
Period = 1/100 = 0.01 seconds (10ms). In 45ms, you get 45/10 = 4.5 cycles. This is enough for a rough pitch perception.
- At 1000 Hz (e.g., near B4):
Period = 1/1000 = 0.001 seconds (1ms). In 45ms, you get 45/1 = 45 cycles. This is easily perceived as a clear pitch.
- At 20 kHz (highest audible frequency):
Period = 1/20000 = 0.00005 seconds (0.05ms). In 45ms, you get 45/0.05 = 900 cycles. This is far more than needed for pitch perception, but such high frequencies are often perceived as less "musical."

**Conclusion:** Lower frequencies (e.g., 20 Hz) are barely perceivable as distinct pitches in 45ms because they complete less than one cycle. Higher frequencies (e.g., 100 Hz and above) are more likely to be perceived as notes. The exact number of cycles needed for pitch perception varies, but research suggests 2–4 cycles are often sufficient for mid-range frequencies.

**How Many Notes Can Fit in the 20 Hz to 20 kHz Range?**

The range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz spans the entire audible spectrum. In musical terms, this corresponds to all possible notes in the Western 12-tone equal temperament system (and beyond). Let’s estimate:
- The lowest musical note is around A0 (27.5 Hz), and the highest commonly used note is C8 (4186 Hz), though higher frequencies up to 20 kHz could theoretically be perceived as pitches.
- In equal temperament, each octave doubles the frequency, and there are 12 semitones per octave. The number of semitones between two frequencies 
$f_1$ and $f_2$ is given by:
  
$n = 12 \cdot \log_2\left(\frac{f_2}{f_1}\right)$

For 27.5 Hz to 4186 Hz:

$n = 12 \cdot \log_2\left(\frac{4186}{27.5}\right)$ $\approx 12 \cdot \log_2(152.22)$ $\approx 12 \cdot 7.25 \approx 87 \text{ semitones}$

This corresponds to about 7 octaves (since 12 semitones = 1 octave), covering roughly 88 notes (similar to a standard piano).
- Extending to 20 kHz:

$n = 12 \cdot \log_2\left(\frac{20000}{27.5}\right)$ $\approx 12 \cdot \log_2(727.27)$ $\approx 12 \cdot 9.5 \approx 114 \text{ semitones}$

This adds another ~27 semitones, totaling around 115 distinct pitches in the audible range.

However, in a 45ms frame, not all these notes can be distinctly perceived if played simultaneously due to:
- Masking: When multiple frequencies are played at once, louder or lower frequencies can mask higher or quieter ones, reducing the number of distinguishable notes.
- Auditory resolution: The human ear can distinguish individual frequencies if they are sufficiently separated (e.g., by a critical bandwidth, roughly 1/3 octave in mid-frequencies). In polyphonic sound, the ear can typically resolve 5–10 simultaneous notes, depending on their frequency spacing and amplitude.
**Conclusion:** Theoretically, the 20 Hz to 20 kHz range contains ~115 distinct musical notes (semitones). In a 45ms frame, you could play all of them simultaneously, but the ear would only distinguish a subset (likely 5–10 notes) due to masking and perceptual limits.

**Does the Number of Notes Make a Difference?**

Yes, the number of notes played simultaneously in a 45ms frame affects perception:
- Single note: If only one note (e.g., 440 Hz, A4) is played, it’s easily perceived as a pitch in 45ms (~20 cycles).
- Few notes (e.g., a chord): A chord with 3–5 notes (e.g., C-E-G) can be distinguished if the frequencies are spaced appropriately (e.g., in different critical bands). In 45ms, the ear can identify the chord’s quality (major/minor) if the notes are clear.
- Many notes (e.g., 10+): As more notes are added, they start to blend into a complex timbre or noise-like sound. The ear struggles to pick out individual pitches due to masking and cognitive limits. For example, a cluster chord (e.g., all 12 semitones in an octave) in 45ms might sound more like a dense texture than distinct notes.
The amplitude and timbre of each note also matter. Notes with similar frequencies or overlapping harmonics interfere more, reducing clarity. For instance, two notes an octave apart (e.g., 440 Hz and 880 Hz) are easier to distinguish than two notes a semitone apart (e.g., 440 Hz and 466 Hz).
**Conclusion:** The number of notes matters because of auditory masking and perceptual limits. In 45ms, 1–5 notes are clearly distinguishable; beyond that, the sound becomes increasingly complex or noisy.

**What If There Is No Tempo?**

Tempo refers to the rate at which musical events (e.g., notes or beats) occur over time, typically measured in beats per minute (BPM). 

- Notes played simultaneously: If all notes in the 45ms frame start and end at the same time (like a chord), tempo is irrelevant because there’s no rhythmic sequence. The analysis above (about masking and perceptual limits) applies.
- Notes played sequentially: If you mean notes played one after another within 45ms, “no tempo” might imply an arbitrary or extremely fast sequence. Let’s explore this:
  - In 45ms, there’s very little time to play multiple notes sequentially. For example, if each note lasts 10ms, you could fit ~4 notes (45/10 ≈ 4.5). However, at such short durations, the notes blur together, and the ear may not perceive them as distinct events.
  - Without a defined tempo, the sequence lacks rhythmic structure, but the ear still processes the frequencies. If the notes are too short (e.g., <10ms), they may sound like clicks or a single complex sound rather than a melody.
In either case, the absence of tempo doesn’t change the fundamental limits of pitch perception in 45ms. It only affects how we interpret the sound’s rhythmic or sequential structure. Without tempo, the sound might feel “static” (if simultaneous) or “chaotic” (if sequential).
**Conclusion:** No tempo means the notes are either simultaneous (like a chord) or arbitrarily sequenced. In 45ms, simultaneous notes are limited by masking (5–10 distinguishable), and sequential notes are limited by duration (2–4 if very short), often blending into a single sound.

TL,DR:

**How many musical notes can be heard in a 45ms frame?**

Theoretically, you could play all ~115 audible semitones (20 Hz to 20 kHz) in a 45ms frame, but the human ear can only distinguish ~5–10 simultaneous notes due to masking and auditory resolution. Lower frequencies (e.g., 20 Hz) are barely perceptible in 45ms (<1 cycle), while higher frequencies (e.g., 100 Hz and above) are clearer.

**Does the 20 Hz to 20 kHz range fit?**

Yes, the entire 20 Hz to 20 kHz range fits, as it encompasses all audible frequencies. However, in 45ms frame, not all frequencies are equally perceivable as distinct musical notes.

**Does it make a difference how many notes?**

Yes, more notes increase complexity. 1–5 notes are clearly distinguishable; beyond that, the sound becomes dense or noisy due to masking.

**What if there is no tempo?**

Without tempo, notes are either simultaneous (chord-like, limited to ~5–10 distinguishable pitches) or sequential (2–4 very short notes, often blending). The absence of tempo doesn’t change the perceptual limits in 45ms.


## Sequential approach 

In a sequential approach within a 45ms frame, the shortest duration for musical notes to be coherently perceived as distinct pitches by the human auditory system is approximately 5–10 ms for mid-to-high frequencies (e.g., 200–2000 Hz). This is based on the need for 2–4 cycles of a sound wave for pitch recognition and the auditory system's temporal resolution of ~2–5 ms for distinguishing sequential events.

**Key Points:**

- Minimum note duration: 
  - Mid-to-high frequencies (e.g., 440 Hz, A4): ~5 ms (2 cycles) to 10 ms (4 cycles) ensures clear pitch perception.
   -Lower frequencies (e.g., 50 Hz): ~20–40 ms is needed, limiting the sequence to 1–2 notes in 45ms.

- Number of notes in 45ms:
   - Without gaps: ~4–9 notes (5–10 ms each).
   -With small gaps (e.g., 2 ms for separation): ~3–6 notes (7–12 ms per note + gap).

- Perceptual limits: Notes shorter than 5 ms may sound like clicks or a rapid sweep rather than distinct pitches, especially for lower frequencies. Cognitive processing limits sequences to 6–8 notes per second (125–167 ms per note), so 5–6 notes in 45ms is a practical maximum for melodic clarity.

- Timbre and context: Sharp attack sounds (e.g., piano) enhance separation, allowing shorter notes (closer to 5 ms) to remain distinct compared to smooth sounds.


TL;DR:
The shortest note duration for coherent perception in a sequential approach is ~5–10 ms for mid-to-high frequencies, allowing 4–9 notes without gaps or 3–6 notes with small gaps (2 ms) in a 45ms frame. Lower frequencies require longer durations (20–40 ms), reducing the count to 1–2 notes.

## Transposed convolution 

Often referred to as deconvolution (though not technically accurate), is a technique used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to upsample feature maps. While standard convolution reduces the spatial dimensions of the input (e.g., an image), transposed convolution increases them, effectively performing the opposite operation in terms of dimensionality.

### Pixel-Level Explanation:
1. **Standard Convolution**:
   - Takes an input feature map (e.g., an image) and applies a kernel (filter) to extract features.
   - The kernel slides across the input with a defined **stride** (step size), computing dot products between the kernel and local regions of the input.
   - **Padding** can be added to preserve the spatial dimensions of the input.
   - The result is a smaller feature map (unless padding and stride are carefully chosen).

2. **Transposed Convolution**:
   - Instead of reducing dimensions, transposed convolution increases them by "reversing" the convolution process in terms of shape.
   - It works by inserting zeros between the input pixels (a process known as **upsampling** or **dilation** of the input).
   - The kernel then slides over this expanded input, producing an output feature map larger than the original input.
   - The **stride** in transposed convolution controls the spacing between the input pixels in the upsampled input.
   - **Padding** in transposed convolution is used to control the final output size, often by removing padding from the edges.

### Mathematical Insight:
For a standard convolution, the output size is calculated as:

$$\text{Output Size} = \frac{\text{Input Size} - \text{Kernel Size} + 2 \times \text{Padding}}{\text{Stride}} + 1$$

For transposed convolution, the output size is calculated as:

$$\text{Output Size} = (\text{Input Size} - 1) \times \text{Stride} + \text{Kernel Size} - 2 \times \text{Padding} + \text{Output Padding}$$

### Key Differences:
- **Standard Convolution**: Reduces spatial dimensions, extracting features.
- **Transposed Convolution**: Increases spatial dimensions, used for upsampling.
- **Not a True Inverse**: While transposed convolution can reverse the spatial dimensions of a convolution, it does not reverse the actual values—some information is lost during the standard convolution process.

### Applications:
- **Image Generation**: Used in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate high-resolution images from low-dimensional noise.
- **Image Segmentation**: Helps in upsampling feature maps to match the original image size for pixel-wise predictions.
- **Autoencoders**: Used in the decoder part to reconstruct the input from a compressed representation.

### Example:
Given a 2x2 input matrix:
```
0 & 1 
2 & 3
```

Using a 2x2 kernel and stride of 1 with no padding, transposed convolution can produce a 3x3 output:

```
0 & 0 & 1 
0 & 4 & 6 
4 & 12 & 9
 ```
This output is formed by broadcasting each input pixel through the kernel, effectively "expanding" the input.

## **Deep dive** 

> "The kernel slides across the input with a defined stride (step size), computing dot products between the kernel and local regions of the input."

This is the core mechanism of a **convolution operation**, which is fundamental in **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, especially for image processing.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### 1. **Input and Kernel (Filter)**

- **Input**: Think of this as a 2D grid (e.g., a grayscale image), or a 3D volume (e.g., a color image with height × width × channels like RGB).
  
  Example (2D grayscale image):
  ```
  Input:
  [ 1  2  3  4 ]
  [ 5  6  7  8 ]
  [ 9 10 11 12 ]
  [13 14 15 16 ]
  ```

- **Kernel (Filter)**: A smaller matrix (e.g., 2x2 or 3x3) that acts as a feature detector.
  
  Example (2x2 kernel):
  ```
  Kernel:
  [ 0  1 ]
  [ 2  3 ]
  ```

---

#### 2. **Sliding the Kernel (Stride)**

- **Stride** is the number of pixels the kernel moves (steps) after each operation.

- With **stride = 1**, the kernel moves one pixel at a time (horizontally and vertically).
  
  Example of positions where the kernel slides over the input (for 2x2 kernel and 4x4 input with stride = 1):

  - Top-left: covers top-left 2x2 region
  - Move right: covers top-middle 2x2 region
  - Continue until the end of the row
  - Then move down one row and repeat

---

#### 3. **Dot Product at Each Position**

At each position, the kernel is **multiplied element-wise** with the input region it’s covering, and then summed up.

Let’s do this manually:

**First Position (Top-left):**
```
Input region:
[ 1  2 ]
[ 5  6 ]

Kernel:
[ 0  1 ]
[ 2  3 ]

Element-wise multiplication:
(1×0) + (2×1) + (5×2) + (6×3) = 0 + 2 + 10 + 18 = 30
```

This gives one value in the output feature map.

Repeat this for every possible position the kernel slides to.

---

#### 4. **Resulting Feature Map**

All the dot products are stacked together into a new 2D matrix: the **feature map**.

If input is 4×4 and kernel is 2×2 with stride = 1, the output feature map will be:
```
Output (Feature Map):
[ 30   36   42 ]
[ 84   90   96 ]
[138 144  150 ]
```

This feature map highlights where the kernel (pattern) is most present in the original image.

---

### Visual Summary
```
| Step | Description                                                                           
|------|
|  1   | Select a small kernel (e.g., 3x3) 
|  2   | Place it at the top-left of the input image 
|  3   | Multiply each input pixel with the corresponding kernel value, sum them → dot product 
|  4   | Move kernel by `stride` pixels to the right 
|  5   | When reaching the end of a row, move down by `stride` rows 
|  6   | Repeat until kernel has covered the entire image 
|  7   | Result is a new, smaller matrix: the **feature map** 
```
---

### Key Concepts

- **Local Receptive Field**: The small region of the input that the kernel covers at each step.
- **Weight Sharing**: The same kernel is used across the entire image → fewer parameters than fully connected layers.
- **Feature Detection**: Different kernels detect different features (edges, corners, textures, etc.)

---

### Why Is This Useful?

- **Spatial Hierarchy**: CNNs learn increasingly complex features (edges → shapes → objects).
- **Translation Invariance**: Similar patterns are detected regardless of position.
- **Efficiency**: Uses weight sharing and local connectivity to reduce parameters.

---

###  Try It Yourself (Pseudocode)

```python
def apply_convolution(input, kernel, stride):
    output = []
    for i in range(0, input.height - kernel.height + 1, stride):
        row = []
        for
```
## In detail

Let's clarify and expand.

---

### The Input is 4x4 (16 pixels total)

Your example input:
```
[ 1  2  3  4 ]
[ 5  6  7  8 ]
[ 9 10 11 12 ]
[13 14 15 16 ]
```
This is a 4×4 matrix — that’s 16 pixels total.

---

### The Kernel is 2x2 (4 pixels)

Your kernel:
```
[ 0  1 ]
[ 2  3 ]
```
This is a 2×2 filter — 4 weights total.

---

## How Does Stride = 1 Work?

### Common Convention:
- The kernel **slides (moves) from left to right**, and **after finishing a row, moves down by one row**.
- So the direction is:
  - **→ (left to right)** per row
  - **↓ (top to bottom)** between rows


---

## Let's Step Through the Example

Original input:
```
Row 0: [ 1  2  3  4 ]
Row 1: [ 5  6  7  8 ]
Row 2: [ 9 10 11 12 ]
Row 3: [13 14 15 16 ]
```

### First Kernel Position (Top-left):
Covers:
```
[1  2]
[5  6]
```

### Then Stride = 1 → Move Right:
Covers:
```
[2  3]
[6  7]
```

### Then Move Right Again:
Covers:
```
[3  4]
[7  8]
```

### Then Move Down to Next Row:
Now we start again from the left of the next row:
Covers:
```
[5  6]
[9 10]
```

And so on...

---

## Output Feature Map Coordinates

If you label each top-left pixel of the kernel’s position as `(i, j)` in the input, the kernel visits:
- `(0,0)` → top-left
- `(0,1)` → move right
- `(0,2)` → move right again
- `(1,0)` → move down
- `(1,1)` → etc.

This is how the kernel "scans" the image.

---

## Output Feature Map Size

Using the formula:

$$
\text{Output size} = \frac{\text{Input size} - \text{Kernel size}}{\text{Stride}} + 1
$$

So for:
- Input: `4x4`
- Kernel: `2x2`
- Stride: `1`

$$
\text{Output size} = \frac{4 - 2}{1} + 1 = 3 \Rightarrow \text{Output is } 3 \times 3
$$

---

## Summary 

> "If we were looking at pixels 1,2,5,6 by the kernel and then it strides 1, would we be looking at pixels 3,4,7,8?"


- First: kernel covers:
  ```
  [1 2]
  [5 6]
  ```
- After stride = 1 (move right by one):
  ```
  [2 3]
  [6 7]
  ```
- Next:
  ```
  [3 4]
  [7 8]
  ```


---

##  What is Padding?

**Padding** is a technique used in convolutional operations to **add extra pixels around the borders of the input image or feature map**, before applying the convolution.

###  Purpose of Padding:
- To **preserve spatial dimensions** (i.e., keep the output feature map the same size as the input).
- To **allow the kernel to capture information from the edges** of the input (without padding, edge pixels are seen by fewer filters, which can lead to loss of information).

---

##  Types of Padding

There are two main types:

### 1. **Zero Padding (Most Common)**
- Adds zeros around the borders.
- Most widely used in CNNs.
- Also called "constant padding".

### 2. **Other Types (Less Common)**
- **Replication Padding**: Repeats the edge values.
- **Reflection Padding**: Reflects the input values at the border.
- **Circular Padding**: Treats the input as circular.

---

##  How Padding Affects Output Size

Recall the **output size formula** of a convolution:

$$\text{Output Size} = \frac{\text{Input Size} + 2 \times \text{Padding} - \text{Kernel Size}}{\text{Stride}} + 1$$

Where:
- `Input Size` = spatial dimension (height or width) of the input
- `Padding` = number of pixels added to each side
- `Kernel Size` = size of the convolution filter
- `Stride` = step size

---

##  Example with Padding

Let’s use:
- Input size: `4x4`
- Kernel size: `2x2`
- Stride: `1`
- Padding: `0` (no padding)

Output size:

$$\frac{4 - 2}{1} + 1 = 3 \Rightarrow 3x3 \text{ output}$$

Now, **add padding = 1**:

Input effectively becomes `6x6` (4 + 2×1), so:

$$\frac{4 + 2×1 - 2}{1} + 1 = \frac{4}{1} + 1 = 5 \Rightarrow 5x5 \text{ output}$$

If you want the **same size as input**, you choose padding so that:

$$\text{Output Size} = \text{Input Size}$$

Let’s solve for that:

$$\text{Input Size} = \frac{\text{Input Size} + 2 \times \text{Padding} - \text{Kernel Size}}{\text{Stride}} + 1$$

Let’s simplify this for **stride = 1**:

$$\text{Padding} = \frac{\text{Kernel Size} - 1}{2}$$

So:
- For kernel size 3×3 → padding = 1
- For kernel size 5×5 → padding = 2
- For kernel size 2×2 → padding = 0.5  (not possible, so not used for stride 1)

---

## Visual Example

Without padding:
```
Input (4x4):
[ 1  2  3  4 ]
[ 5  6  7  8 ]
[ 9 10 11 12 ]
[13 14 15 16 ]
```

After adding **padding = 1** (zero-padding):
```
[0 0  0  0  0  0]
[0 1  2  3  4  0]
[0 5  6  7  8  0]
[0 9 10 11 12  0]
[0 13 14 15 16 0]
[0 0  0  0  0  0]
```

Now we can apply the kernel at all original positions **and** at the edges.

---

##  Why Is Padding Important?

1. **Preserves Resolution**: Without padding, each convolution shrinks the image → deep networks would lose spatial size too quickly.
2. **Edge Information**: Without padding, edge pixels are involved in fewer convolutions → less information learned from them.
3. **Better Performance**: Padding is often used to maintain resolution while learning deeper representations.

---

##  Example in Practice (Using PyTorch-like Syntax)

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Input: batch of 1 grayscale 4x4 image
input = torch.tensor
```

## Here’s a simplified example using real pixel values to generate a feature map:

For a convolutional neural network (CNN) processes grayscale images by applying convolutional kernels (filters) to extract meaningful features. 

1. **Input Image (Grayscale)**: Consider a 5x5 grayscale image with pixel values normalized between 0 and 1:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0.1 & 0.2 & 0.3 & 0.4 & 0.5 \\
0.6 & 0.7 & 0.8 & 0.9 & 1.0 \\
0.2 & 0.3 & 0.4 & 0.5 & 0.6 \\
0.7 & 0.8 & 0.9 & 1.0 & 0.1 \\
0.3 & 0.4 & 0.5 & 0.6 & 0.7 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

2. **Convolutional Kernel (Filter)**: Use a 3x3 kernel designed for edge detection:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & -1 & -1 \\
-1 &  8 & -1 \\
-1 & -1 & -1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

3. **Convolution Operation**:
   - Slide the kernel over the input image with a stride of 1.
   - Compute the dot product between the kernel and the corresponding section of the image.
   - For the top-left 3x3 section of the image:
   

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0.1 & 0.2 & 0.3 \\
0.6 & 0.7 & 0.8 \\
0.2 & 0.3 & 0.4
\end{bmatrix}
\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & -1 & -1 \\
-1 &  8 & -1 \\
-1 & -1 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
= (0.1 \cdot -1) + (0.2 \cdot -1) + (0.3 \cdot -1) + (0.6 \cdot -1) + (0.7 \cdot 8) + (0.8 \cdot -1) + (0.2 \cdot -1) + (0.3 \cdot -1) + (0.4 \cdot -1)
$$

$$
= -0.1 - 0.2 - 0.3 - 0.6 + 5.6 - 0.8 - 0.2 - 0.3 - 0.4 = 2.7
$$

4. **Feature Map**: Repeat the operation across the entire image to generate a feature map. For example, the resulting feature map might look like:
   
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
  2.7 & 3.0 & 3.3 \\
  3.6 & 4.0 & 4.4 \\
  4.5 & 5.0 & 5.5
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This feature map highlights areas of the image where edges or abrupt changes in intensity occur, which the CNN can use to detect patterns relevant to the task, such as object boundaries. During training, the CNN learns optimal filter values to maximize the detection of task-relevant features.

## Depth estimation** or **Stereo vision**

Where disparity (often the inverse of depth) is predicted, and losses are crafted to be **invariant to scale and shift**—which is crucial in many monocular depth prediction settings where absolute depth cannot be recovered.

Let’s break this down into key ideas:

---

## **1. Prediction in Disparity Space**

* **Disparity**: In stereo vision, disparity is the difference in the horizontal position of a pixel in the left and right images. It’s inversely related to depth:

  $$
  d = \frac{f \cdot B}{Z}
  $$

  where:

  * $d$: disparity
  * $f$: focal length
  * $B$: baseline (distance between cameras)
  * $Z$: depth

* **Inverse Depth Up to Scale and Shift**: In monocular depth estimation, the predicted inverse depth (disparity) is **only accurate up to a global scale and shift**, because without stereo or known camera motion, absolute depth can’t be recovered.

---

## **2. Scale- and Shift-Invariant Dense Losses**

These are loss functions that are:

* **Dense**: Evaluate every pixel (not sparse or point-wise)
* **Invariant to scale and shift**: So that predicted depth maps don’t have to match the absolute depth values exactly — only the **structure** of the scene needs to be correct (e.g., depth relationships between pixels)

### Common examples:

#### a) **Scale-and-Shift-Invariant MSE**

From *"Dense Depth Estimation Without Dense Ground Truth" (Watson et al., CVPR 2019)*:

$$
\min_{\alpha, \beta} \| \alpha \hat{d} + \beta - d \|^2
$$

* Here, $\hat{d}$ is the predicted disparity/depth
* $d$ is ground truth
* $\alpha$, $\beta$ are optimal scale and shift to align the prediction with ground truth before computing the error

#### b) **Gradient and SSIM Losses**

Losses based on:

* **Image gradients** (to preserve edges and structure)
* **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**, which compares local luminance, contrast, and structure

These help the model focus on *relative* depth structure rather than exact values.

---

## **Use Case Summary**

This approach is most useful when:

* Training with **monocular images** (where scale is ambiguous)
* Evaluating or supervising using **depth maps or disparities** that might be scaled or shifted relative to the ground truth

**Geometry of disparity and inverse depth**
---

## **Q: Can disparity be computed using an image split in half (left/right parts), or must it be from two different cameras?**

### Short Answer:

**Disparity estimation assumes two views of the same scene from **different perspectives** (i.e., different camera centers). Just splitting a single image in half does *not* give you valid disparity — unless you simulate the geometric effect of a second viewpoint.**

---

## Let’s understand this mathematically.

### 1. **What is Disparity?**

Disparity is defined as:

$$
d(u, v) = x_L(u, v) - x_R(u, v)
$$

Where:

* $x_L(u, v)$: horizontal coordinate in the left image
* $x_R(u, v)$: matching horizontal coordinate in the right image (same 3D point)

In **pinhole camera model**, disparity relates to depth via:

$$
Z = \frac{f \cdot B}{d}
\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad
d = \frac{f \cdot B}{Z}
$$

Where:

* $Z$: depth (distance from camera to point in 3D)
* $f$: focal length
* $B$: baseline (distance between camera centers)
* $d$: disparity

So, disparity arises *because* two cameras are located at different positions — **parallax** causes the same 3D point to project to different positions in the two images.

---

### 2. **What if I split a single image in half?**

Let’s suppose you take a single image $I$ and split it into:

* $I_L$: left half
* $I_R$: right half

Now you try to compute disparity between $I_L$ and $I_R$.

#### Why this is **invalid geometrically**:

There is **no camera motion** between $I_L$ and $I_R$. Both halves are from the **same optical center**. Every pixel was projected through the same pinhole.

* There’s no *true parallax*.
* There’s no *triangulation* baseline $B$.
* Any difference between $I_L$ and $I_R$ would be **due to scene content variation**, not geometry.

#### Mathematical contradiction:

Suppose we try to use disparity formula:

$$
Z = \frac{f \cdot B}{d}
$$

But since $B = 0$ (no second camera), we get:

$$
Z = \frac{f \cdot 0}{d} = 0
$$

Or, you might say $d = 0$ (since pixel positions don’t change), which implies $Z \to \infty$ — again, nonsensical.

---

### 3. **Can we simulate disparity with a synthetic shift?**

You *can* simulate stereo data from a single image by:

* Assuming a proxy depth map or plane
* Shifting pixels **as if** they came from another camera

But this requires:

* Knowledge of scene depth
* Geometry-based image warping

In that case, you're synthesizing a **novel view** from a slightly shifted camera pose (i.e., generating stereo).

---

### 4. **Why real stereo or multi-view is needed for disparity?**

Because the disparity is a **proxy for depth**, and depth arises from the triangulation of multiple rays intersecting in 3D space. Without a baseline $B$, the rays are all the same — there's no triangle to form.

This also explains why **monocular depth estimation** models:

* Predict **inverse depth up to scale and shift**
* Must be trained using stereo pairs or known 3D priors to learn geometric cues

Synthesizing a **novel view**—i.e., generating what a scene would look like from a different (virtual) camera viewpoint—is a core problem in **computer vision and graphics**, especially in **view synthesis**, **stereo simulation**, and **NeRF-style rendering**.

## Main approaches **by input and technique**:

---

##  1. **Depth-based Image Warping**

**Input**: RGB image + predicted or known depth
**Output**: Synthesized view from a nearby virtual camera

### Method:

Use the depth map to **project pixels to 3D**, then re-project to the target camera pose.

#### Steps:

1. For each pixel $(u,v)$ , use depth $Z(u,v)$ to compute 3D point in world space:

$$
\mathbf{X} = Z(u,v) \cdot K^{-1} [u, v, 1]^T
$$

   where $K$ is the intrinsic matrix.

2. Transform the 3D point using relative pose $[R|t]$ to the new view.

3. Reproject into the target view’s image plane:

$$
[u', v', 1]^T \propto K' \cdot (R \cdot \mathbf{X} + t)
$$

4. Use **backward warping** (resampling source image at target pixel locations) for image synthesis.

###  Pros:

* Simple, fast
* Works well for small viewpoint changes

###  Cons:

* Missing data (occlusions)
* Artifacts near depth edges
* Assumes Lambertian surfaces

---

##  2. **Multi-Plane Images (MPIs)**

**Input**: Single or few RGB images
**Output**: Novel view synthesized using a stack of semi-transparent depth layers

### Method:

1. Discretize scene into fronto-parallel planes at fixed depths
2. Learn per-plane **RGB + alpha (opacity)** layers
3. Composite the layers from back to front to render novel views via **plane sweep** and blending

 **Introduced in**:
*“Stereo Magnification” (Zhou et al., SIGGRAPH 2018)*

###  Pros:

* Differentiable rendering
* Handles view extrapolation better than depth warping

###  Cons:

* Requires training
* Limited depth fidelity (discrete planes)

---

##  3. **Neural Rendering / NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields)**

**Input**: Multiple posed images (monocular or stereo)
**Output**: Synthesized views from arbitrary camera positions

### Method:

1. Represent scene as a neural function:

$$
F(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{d}) \rightarrow (c, \sigma)
$$

   where:

   * $\mathbf{x}$ : 3D location
   * $\mathbf{d}$ : viewing direction
   * $c$ : color
   * $\sigma$ : density

2. Render images via **volume rendering** along camera rays.

 **Introduced in**:
*“NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis” (Mildenhall et al., ECCV 2020)*

###  Pros:

* Extremely high-quality rendering
* Supports complex geometry and view-dependent lighting

###  Cons:

* Expensive to train and render
* Needs many views with accurate camera poses

---

##  4. **Flow-based View Synthesis**

**Input**: Source image(s), predicted optical flow (or disparity)
**Output**: Warp source images to target view using learned flow fields

 Examples:

* *DeepStereo (Flynn et al.)*
* *SynSin (Wiles et al.)*

###  Method:

* Predict a dense pixel correspondence (flow or disparity) between views
* Warp source image using this mapping
* Fill holes with learned refinement network

---

##  5. **Image-to-Image Translation with Pose Conditioning**

**Input**: Source image + target pose or viewpoint
**Output**: Synthesized novel view

 Examples:

* *Pix2Pix-style models with pose*
* *ViewNet, GQN (Generative Query Networks)*

###  Method:

* Train a conditional GAN or autoencoder that learns to “imagine” the new view
* Implicitly encodes scene geometry

###  Limitation:

* Poor geometric consistency
* Generalizes poorly outside training distribution
