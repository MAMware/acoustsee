The physics of sound, human auditory perception, and music theory. 

Given a 45ms frame, the frequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz, and the role of tempo.

Understanding the 45ms Frame
A 45ms (0.045-second) frame is a very short duration of sound. To determine how many musical notes can be heard in this time, we need to consider:
- Human perception of pitch: For a sound to be perceived as a distinct musical note (with a recognizable pitch), the auditory system typically requires at least a few cycles of the sound wave. Lower frequencies (e.g., 20 Hz) have longer wavelengths, so fewer cycles fit in 45ms, making it harder to perceive pitch accurately compared to higher frequencies.
- Frequency range: The human hearing range is approximately 20 Hz to 20 kHz, which covers all audible musical notes (from roughly A0 at ~27.5 Hz to beyond C8 at ~4186 Hz, and even higher frequencies).

Let’s calculate the number of cycles for some frequencies in 45ms:
- At 20 Hz (lowest audible frequency):
Period = 1/20 = 0.05 seconds (50ms). In 45ms, you get 45/50 = 0.9 cycles. This is less than one full cycle, so it’s unlikely to be perceived as a distinct pitch.
- At 100 Hz (e.g., near G2):
Period = 1/100 = 0.01 seconds (10ms). In 45ms, you get 45/10 = 4.5 cycles. This is enough for a rough pitch perception.
- At 1000 Hz (e.g., near B4):
Period = 1/1000 = 0.001 seconds (1ms). In 45ms, you get 45/1 = 45 cycles. This is easily perceived as a clear pitch.
- At 20 kHz (highest audible frequency):
Period = 1/20000 = 0.00005 seconds (0.05ms). In 45ms, you get 45/0.05 = 900 cycles. This is far more than needed for pitch perception, but such high frequencies are often perceived as less "musical."

**Conclusion:** Lower frequencies (e.g., 20 Hz) are barely perceivable as distinct pitches in 45ms because they complete less than one cycle. Higher frequencies (e.g., 100 Hz and above) are more likely to be perceived as notes. The exact number of cycles needed for pitch perception varies, but research suggests 2–4 cycles are often sufficient for mid-range frequencies.

How Many Notes Can Fit in the 20 Hz to 20 kHz Range?
The range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz spans the entire audible spectrum. In musical terms, this corresponds to all possible notes in the Western 12-tone equal temperament system (and beyond). Let’s estimate:
- The lowest musical note is around A0 (27.5 Hz), and the highest commonly used note is C8 (4186 Hz), though higher frequencies up to 20 kHz could theoretically be perceived as pitches.
- In equal temperament, each octave doubles the frequency, and there are 12 semitones per octave. The number of semitones between two frequencies 
f_1 and f_2 is given by:
  
n = 12 \cdot \log_2\left(\frac{f_2}{f_1}\right)

For 27.5 Hz to 4186 Hz:  
n = 12 \cdot \log_2\left(\frac{4186}{27.5}\right) \approx 12 \cdot \log_2(152.22) \approx 12 \cdot 7.25 \approx 87 \text{ semitones}

This corresponds to about 7 octaves (since 12 semitones = 1 octave), covering roughly 88 notes (similar to a standard piano).
- Extending to 20 kHz:  
n = 12 \cdot \log_2\left(\frac{20000}{27.5}\right) \approx 12 \cdot \log_2(727.27) \approx 12 \cdot 9.5 \approx 114 \text{ semitones}

This adds another ~27 semitones, totaling around 115 distinct pitches in the audible range.

However, in a 45ms frame, not all these notes can be distinctly perceived if played simultaneously due to:
- Masking: When multiple frequencies are played at once, louder or lower frequencies can mask higher or quieter ones, reducing the number of distinguishable notes.
- Auditory resolution: The human ear can distinguish individual frequencies if they are sufficiently separated (e.g., by a critical bandwidth, roughly 1/3 octave in mid-frequencies). In polyphonic sound, the ear can typically resolve 5–10 simultaneous notes, depending on their frequency spacing and amplitude.
**Conclusion:** Theoretically, the 20 Hz to 20 kHz range contains ~115 distinct musical notes (semitones). In a 45ms frame, you could play all of them simultaneously, but the ear would only distinguish a subset (likely 5–10 notes) due to masking and perceptual limits.

Does the Number of Notes Make a Difference?
Yes, the number of notes played simultaneously in a 45ms frame affects perception:
- Single note: If only one note (e.g., 440 Hz, A4) is played, it’s easily perceived as a pitch in 45ms (~20 cycles).
- Few notes (e.g., a chord): A chord with 3–5 notes (e.g., C-E-G) can be distinguished if the frequencies are spaced appropriately (e.g., in different critical bands). In 45ms, the ear can identify the chord’s quality (major/minor) if the notes are clear.
- Many notes (e.g., 10+): As more notes are added, they start to blend into a complex timbre or noise-like sound. The ear struggles to pick out individual pitches due to masking and cognitive limits. For example, a cluster chord (e.g., all 12 semitones in an octave) in 45ms might sound more like a dense texture than distinct notes.
The amplitude and timbre of each note also matter. Notes with similar frequencies or overlapping harmonics interfere more, reducing clarity. For instance, two notes an octave apart (e.g., 440 Hz and 880 Hz) are easier to distinguish than two notes a semitone apart (e.g., 440 Hz and 466 Hz).
**Conclusion:** The number of notes matters because of auditory masking and perceptual limits. In 45ms, 1–5 notes are clearly distinguishable; beyond that, the sound becomes increasingly complex or noisy.

What If There Is No Tempo?
Tempo refers to the rate at which musical events (e.g., notes or beats) occur over time, typically measured in beats per minute (BPM). In your question, “no tempo” could mean:
- Notes played simultaneously: If all notes in the 45ms frame start and end at the same time (like a chord), tempo is irrelevant because there’s no rhythmic sequence. The analysis above (about masking and perceptual limits) applies.
- Notes played sequentially: If you mean notes played one after another within 45ms, “no tempo” might imply an arbitrary or extremely fast sequence. Let’s explore this:
  - In 45ms, there’s very little time to play multiple notes sequentially. For example, if each note lasts 10ms, you could fit ~4 notes (45/10 ≈ 4.5). However, at such short durations, the notes blur together, and the ear may not perceive them as distinct events.
  - Without a defined tempo, the sequence lacks rhythmic structure, but the ear still processes the frequencies. If the notes are too short (e.g., <10ms), they may sound like clicks or a single complex sound rather than a melody.
In either case, the absence of tempo doesn’t change the fundamental limits of pitch perception in 45ms. It only affects how we interpret the sound’s rhythmic or sequential structure. Without tempo, the sound might feel “static” (if simultaneous) or “chaotic” (if sequential).
**Conclusion:** No tempo means the notes are either simultaneous (like a chord) or arbitrarily sequenced. In 45ms, simultaneous notes are limited by masking (5–10 distinguishable), and sequential notes are limited by duration (2–4 if very short), often blending into a single sound.

TL,DR:

**How many musical notes can be heard in a 45ms frame?**
Theoretically, you could play all ~115 audible semitones (20 Hz to 20 kHz) in a 45ms frame, but the human ear can only distinguish ~5–10 simultaneous notes due to masking and auditory resolution. Lower frequencies (e.g., 20 Hz) are barely perceptible in 45ms (<1 cycle), while higher frequencies (e.g., 100 Hz and above) are clearer.

**Does the 20 Hz to 20 kHz range fit?**
Yes, the entire 20 Hz to 20 kHz range fits, as it encompasses all audible frequencies. However, in 45ms frame, not all frequencies are equally perceivable as distinct musical notes.

**Does it make a difference how many notes?**
Yes, more notes increase complexity. 1–5 notes are clearly distinguishable; beyond that, the sound becomes dense or noisy due to masking.

**What if there is none tempo?**
Without tempo, notes are either simultaneous (chord-like, limited to ~5–10 distinguishable pitches) or sequential (2–4 very short notes, often blending). The absence of tempo doesn’t change the perceptual limits in 45ms.
If you’d like, I can clarify further, provide calculations for specific notes, or explore related topics (e.g., or Fourier analysis of short sounds). Let me know!

## Sequential approach 

In a sequential approach within a 45ms frame, the shortest duration for musical notes to be coherently perceived as distinct pitches by the human auditory system is approximately 5–10 ms for mid-to-high frequencies (e.g., 200–2000 Hz). This is based on the need for 2–4 cycles of a sound wave for pitch recognition and the auditory system's temporal resolution of ~2–5 ms for distinguishing sequential events.

**Key Points:**

- Minimum note duration: 
  - Mid-to-high frequencies (e.g., 440 Hz, A4): ~5 ms (2 cycles) to 10 ms (4 cycles) ensures clear pitch perception.
   -Lower frequencies (e.g., 50 Hz): ~20–40 ms is needed, limiting the sequence to 1–2 notes in 45ms.

- Number of notes in 45ms:
   - Without gaps: ~4–9 notes (5–10 ms each).
   -With small gaps (e.g., 2 ms for separation): ~3–6 notes (7–12 ms per note + gap).

- Perceptual limits: Notes shorter than 5 ms may sound like clicks or a rapid sweep rather than distinct pitches, especially for lower frequencies. Cognitive processing limits sequences to 6–8 notes per second (125–167 ms per note), so 5–6 notes in 45ms is a practical maximum for melodic clarity.

- Timbre and context: Sharp attack sounds (e.g., piano) enhance separation, allowing shorter notes (closer to 5 ms) to remain distinct compared to smooth sounds.

TL;DR:
The shortest note duration for coherent perception in a sequential approach is ~5–10 ms for mid-to-high frequencies, allowing 4–9 notes without gaps or 3–6 notes with small gaps (2 ms) in a 45ms frame. Lower frequencies require longer durations (20–40 ms), reducing the count to 1–2 notes.
