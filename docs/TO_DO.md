# Future Features
Sorted by priority

- UI: Haptic feedback via Vibration API, console log on device screen for debugin.
- Detailed performance analisis and sectioned metrics.
- Optimizations aiming the use of less resources and better performance.

Consider:

- Performance optimization for the web such as Web Workers and WebAssembly.
- Testing true HRTF, load CIPIC HRIR data.
- Gabor filters for motion detection.
- Reintroducing Hilbert curves.
- Android/iOS app developtment if considerable performance gain can be achieved.

UI: The top trapezoid is (should be) where the setting toggle is, this toggle shifts the function of the lateral trapezoid a the left (dayNight toggle without shift) and right (languaje selectror for speech synthesis) for a cursor for options navigation such as grid and synth engine both versioned selector.

The confirmation is done by pressing the center vertical rectagunlar square, that also works as webcam feed preview/canvas

The start and stop of the navigation is donde by pressing the buttom trapezoid.

A reintroduction of a frames per seconds (FPS) toggle that is usefull if your device stutters or generates artifacts due to processing issues, likely by a cpu processor limitation will be reconsidered as a configuration option, among the grid and synth engine selector.

A console log live view and a copy feature is being considered too.
