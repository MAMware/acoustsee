Updated Changelog
## Efforts Achieved
Milestone 1: Proof of Concept
A Python code that handles static images from an example folder and successfully generates a WAV file with basic stereo audio, left/right panning.

Milestone 2: Minimum Viable Product
A JavaScript web version to process the user’s live video feed privately, framing a "Hilbert curve" (simplified as a zig-zag) and synthesizing sound to emulate a head-related transfer function (HRTF).

Milestone 3: Tested Different Approaches with Fast, Raw Iterations
Subfolders fft, hrtf, and tonnetz each represent different approaches.

Current selected main soundscape generator uses the Euler Tonnetz approach, splitting the video frame into left/right halves, mapped to a hexagonal Euler Tonnetz grid (32x32 per half, 2048 notes total).

Features a day/night mode that inverts sound generation based on lighting conditions.

Sound synthesis engine aims for real-time 50ms updates (toggleable to 100ms, 250ms) with up to 16 notes per side (32 total).

UI: Centered video, with the remaining screen split into three sections—lower half for start/stop, upper div with FPS settings on the left and day/night toggle on the right (work in progress).

Transitioned from Trunk-Based Development to a Single Responsibility Principle (modular) approach.

Set up GitHub branches for development with CI/CD in place.

## Changelog
v0.3.1 - June 14, 2025
Milestone: Integrated Changelog and Stability Enhancements
Integrated latest developments into a comprehensive changelog, merging work from current and past conversations up to June 14, 2025.

Ensured AudioContext initialization stability by reinforcing user gesture requirements and centralizing management in main.js with global window.audioContext.

Added detailed logging in initializeAudio to diagnose and resolve audio start issues reported in rectangle-handlers.js (lines 25 and 27).

Maintained modular approach with rectangle-handlers.js for UI event management, ensuring compatibility with main.js.

Verified day/night mode and inherent spectra functionality, aligning with MAMware’s Ableton Push grid vision.

v0.3.0 - June 10, 2025
Milestone: Audio Context Fix and Enhanced Stability
Fixed AudioContext initialization error ("not allowed to start") reported in rectangle-handlers.js lines 25 and 27 by centralizing audioContext management in main.js and exposing it globally via window.audioContext.

Ensured all audio operations (creation, resumption) are tied to user gestures (e.g., tapping Start/Stop button).

Added rectangle-handlers.js to manage UI event listeners, integrating with the global audioContext to avoid conflicts.

Improved error handling and logging in initializeAudio to debug audio initialization issues.

Updated index.html to include rectangle-handlers.js script.

v0.2.9.0 - June 11, 2025 (Parallel FFT Development)
Milestone: FFT-Based Brown Noise Soundscape for Accessibility
Implemented continuous brown noise baseline in web/fft/index.html, replacing sine/sawtooth oscillators, for a subtle, comfortable soundscape for the visually impaired (inspired by MAMware’s vision).

Added StereoPannerNode for spatial audio, panning left/right based on bright object positions (azimuth: -1 to 1).

Introduced low-pass filter (BiquadFilterNode) to modulate brown noise pitch (500–2000 Hz) based on FFT intensity.

Added approach detection, triggering speech feedback (“Object approaching”) when intensity increases significantly (>10).

Enhanced accessibility with Web Speech API feedback (“Camera started”, “Audio started/stopped”, “Log shown/hidden”) and touch-based audio toggle.

Reduced fftSize to 32768 for better mobile performance while retaining FFT energy analysis.

Updated web/fft/index.html to prioritize brown noise, addressing MAMware’s feedback on main demo’s “annoying 8-bit” audio.

Hid debug log by default and adjusted FFT intensity mapping to align with main.js’s inverse luma logic.

v0.2.8.6 - June 11, 2025 (Parallel FFT Development)
Milestone: FFT Enhancements and Accessibility
Reintroduced two-oscillator setup (sine + sawtooth) in web/fft/index.html for FFT-based modulation.

Added initial speech feedback (“Audio started/stopped”, “Camera started”) using Web Speech API.

Implemented touch-based audio toggle with #toggleAudioTouch div and keyboard support (spacebar).

Included Google Fonts (‘Roboto’) for consistent styling.

Updated web/fft/index.html CSS to match main.js’s UI and adjusted FFT processing for low-frequency energy.

Fixed aspect ratio issues by dynamically adjusting canvas height and resolved audio initialization errors with context resumption.

v0.2.8.5 - June 07, 2025
Milestone: UI and Audio Stabilization
Adjusted video size and layout in styles.css: Added max-height: 68vh to .main-container and max-width: 80% to .center-rectangle, maintaining video at 200x150px (150x112px < 600px).

Improved ensureAudioContext in main.js to handle initialization/resume errors and forced video.play() in rectangle-handlers.js for synchronization.

Corrected Stop button logic in rectangle-handlers.js with video.pause() and error checking.

Conditioned tryVibrate to run only if isAudioInitialized is true and checked event.cancelable in tryVibrate to avoid touchstart conflicts.

v0.2.3 - June 03, 2025**
Milestone: Performance Optimization and UI Refinement
Optimized main.js by commenting out unnecessary auto-mode suggestions and test tones per MAMware’s feedback.

Adjusted Tonnetz grid to use a hexagonal pattern for better harmonic relationships.

Removed clustering in mapFrameToTonnetz to allow detailed note triggers, aligning with the Ableton Push grid vision.

Increased motion threshold to delta > 50 and used proximity checks to avoid overlap, supporting up to 16 notes per side (32 total).

Enlarged UI buttons to 90x40px in styles.css, positioning them around the video feed.

Reintroduced autoMode toggle with manual day/night switch, inverting luma logic.

Simplified oscillator waveforms to sine to reduce CPU load.

v0.2.2 - May 17, 2025**
Milestone: Inherent Spectra and Day/Night Mode
Implemented inherent audio spectra, removing object inference and using note clusters to reflect object shapes.

Added day/night mode toggle with manual and auto-mode options, inverting luma logic.

Fixed audio engine startup by correcting audioContext creation.

Resolved debug overlay visibility with CSS adjustments.

Implemented pitch encoding and basic oscillators (sine, triangle, square).

Basic UI with video feed, targeting 100ms updates.

Notes on Versioning
Versioning Rationale:
Versions are inferred from significant milestones: v0.1.x for early prototypes, v0.2.x for the initial web release and major features, v0.3.x for stability and modular enhancements, and v0.9.8.x/v0.9.9.x for parallel FFT development.

The shift from Trunk-Based Development to SRP modular approach justifies a jump to v0.3.x, reflecting architectural improvements.

Dates are approximated from our chat timeline (May 11 to June 14, 2025), with FFT milestones dated per your input.
